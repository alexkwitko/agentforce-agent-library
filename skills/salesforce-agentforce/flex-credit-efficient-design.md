# Designing Agentforce for fewer Flex Credits

Agentforce production usage is metered in **Flex Credits**, and the meter is driven by **exposed Agentforce actions**, not by conversation or routing. Design every agent so the LLM *converses and explains* while **Apex/Flow executes the business logic in as few exposed actions as possible**. Always **validate the actual per-action metering in Digital Wallet** — treat the rates and "what counts" below as guidance to confirm, not gospel.

## The pricing reality (confirm in Digital Wallet)
- **Standard / custom Agentforce action ≈ 20 Flex Credits**; **voice action ≈ 30**. (~20 credits ≈ $0.10; 100k credits ≈ $500.)
- An **action** = an exposed step the agent executes: run Apex, run a Flow, answer with Knowledge/retrieval, update a record, summarize, run a prompt template, call a tool/API.
- **Topic / subagent selection inside ONE agent is generally NOT metered as an action** by itself (it's planner reasoning) — but confirm in Digital Wallet, which reports usage by agent/action/use-case.
- **Agent-to-agent (A2A / connected-subagent) handoffs**: the routing itself may be free, but **each connected specialist runs its own billable actions** — validate in Digital Wallet before assuming a topology is "cheaper."

## The one rule
**The cost driver is exposed actions — not topics.** Do not let the LLM "think through" business logic step-by-step by firing action-after-action. Let Salesforce execute the chain inside **one** action.

> Bad: Agent → lookup action → segment action → engagement action → order action → case action → respond. (many billable actions)
> Good: Agent → **one** `getCustomerContext` action (Apex/Flow chains all of it internally) → respond. (one billable action)

## Design patterns that cut credits

1. **Consolidated action chains, never action-over-action.** Each use case = ONE exposed `@InvocableMethod`/Flow that internally does the whole chain (resolve → query CRM + Data Cloud → compute → write record → log → return one compact payload). Build per-use-case orchestrators: `getCustomerContext`, `getLeadContext`, `getCaseContext`, `getProductContext`, `getConsentContext`. A wrapper that internally calls other Apex methods is still **one** agent action.

2. **One unified context action, fetched ONCE per session, cached in a VARIABLE.** Call the shared context orchestrator once; `set` its result into a mutable session variable and reuse the variable in every subagent. Re-calling it per turn burns an action each turn for no new info. Guard it: `if contextLoaded is TRUE, reuse @variables.contextSummary; else call + set the flag and the variable.`
   - ⚠️ **Do NOT** "cache" by writing context to a custom object that each agent then **re-queries** — that read is itself a billable action every turn. Cache in a **session variable** (free within the session). Use a custom journey object only for **cross-session/cross-agent** memory, read **once** via the single context action.

3. **Data Cloud: prepare → package → explain.** Don't let the agent hit Data Cloud N times. **Data Cloud prepares** the intelligence (segments/scores/NBA) — ideally **pre-materialized onto a CRM record asynchronously** (e.g. a `DataCloudAugmentation` service that runs the DMO joins and writes Account fields). **Apex/Flow packages** it into the one context action (a cheap CRM read, not live DMO queries per turn). **Agentforce explains** the result. Note: Data Cloud DMOs queried from Apex run in system mode — enforce your own access/privacy gating.

4. **Return a small, gated payload — not raw records.** The context action returns a compact object (`customerFound`, `identityVerified`/`privacyMode`, `segments`, `recentOrders`, `openCases`, `nextBestAction`, `agentInstruction`), and clears private fields unless verified. Never return 50 raw rows the agent must reason over.

5. **ONE ACTION PER TURN.** Write it into every subagent's reasoning so the planner can't stack 3 actions in a single turn.

6. **Deterministic logic in Apex/Flow/CPQ, not the LLM.** The agent collects inputs and narrates; pricing, eligibility, validation, ranking, dedup, CPQ rules run in code. Fewer model round-trips and fewer actions.

7. **Knowledge/retrieval sparingly.** Use it only when needed; limit retrieval to the top 3–5 chunks.

8. **Topics over agent-to-agent unless there's real reuse.** A monolithic agent with many topics is usually cheaper than A2A orchestration because it avoids extra handoff/planning layers and duplicate context/action calls. Reserve A2A for specialists with genuine standalone reuse (invoked by Flows/other channels too) — and confirm the cost in Digital Wallet.

9. **Lower scorer/evaluation sampling.** Standard scorers (LLM-as-judge) run on a % of sessions and consume credits — sample at ~20%, not 100%, on dev/low-volume orgs.

10. **Keep prompts tight** and avoid redundant tool definitions.

## The layered architecture to aim for
- **Agentforce** = conversation layer (collect + explain)
- **Flow / Apex** = orchestration layer (one consolidated action per use case)
- **Data Cloud / CPQ / Pricing** = decision layer (prepare the intelligence, ideally pre-materialized)
- **Digital Wallet + Agent Analytics** = control layer (meter actual usage by agent/action/use-case; this is the source of truth for what is and isn't billed)

## Quick design checklist
- [ ] Does each use case call exactly ONE exposed action (chain inside Apex/Flow)?
- [ ] Is the shared context action called ONCE per session and cached in a **variable** (not re-queried, not via a re-read custom object)?
- [ ] Is Data Cloud intelligence pre-materialized so the per-turn read is a cheap CRM query?
- [ ] Is "ONE ACTION PER TURN" enforced in every subagent?
- [ ] Is deterministic logic in Apex/Flow, not the model?
- [ ] Are A2A handoffs justified by real reuse (vs. cheaper topics)?
- [ ] Have you validated the real per-action meter in **Digital Wallet** rather than assuming?

## Conversation abuse / loop protection (MANDATORY — every agent ships with it)

Agentforce/MIAW has **NO native repeat-detector, no max-turns cap, and no cooldown** — only a session inactivity timeout. A user (or bot) repeating a question forever keeps the agent answering, and if each repeat re-fires an action (~20 credits) it's runaway cost. You MUST build the protection; an agent without it is not production-ready.

**The metering nuance that drives the design:** Flex Credits meter executed ACTIONS, not turns. So repeats are *cheap* if answered from cache (no action) and *expensive* if each one re-fires an action. Protection = (a) never re-run an action to repeat an answer, (b) a behavioral exit, (c) an edge rate-limit.

**Layer 1 — always-on in-agent guard (mandatory, free).** An agent-level instruction, in scope for every topic:
> "NEVER call an action to re-answer a question already answered this conversation — answer from cache/variables/your prior answer. If the shopper sends essentially the SAME request 3+ times after you answered it, do NOT run any action: acknowledge once, ask if there's anything else, and if they keep repeating, offer a human (open_case escalate=true) or to end the chat, then stop re-engaging that loop."

This is free (no per-turn action), works **mid-session** (the planner judges repetition from the transcript), and directly kills repeat-action burn. **Do NOT implement the counter as a per-turn guard ACTION** — that itself costs ~20 credits/turn and defeats the purpose. Use the instruction + the model's transcript awareness. (Proven live: by the 3rd identical ask the agent stops re-running the action and redirects/offers exit.)

**Layer 2 — in-agent deterministic counter + hard end (VIABLE on native MIAW — PROVEN LIVE; this is the real Layer 2).** Two distinct things, don't confuse them:

- **(2a) Server-side per-message Apex trigger — still NOT viable.** `ConversationEntry` (the per-message object) is NOT Apex-triggerable (`EntityDefinition.IsApexTriggerable = false`); `MessagingSession` IS triggerable but only finalizes `EndUserMessageCount` at session END (reads 0 while Active), so a trigger can't catch a flood mid-conversation. Off-platform: real-time message data is reachable only via the Conversation Data GET API (polling), the Connect REST API, or **Data Cloud sync (≤1-hour latency)** — none give a real-time push hook, and Data Cloud's 1-hour lag is useless for stopping a live flood (good only for after-the-fact abuse analytics). There is also **no native "end chat" utility** in Agent Script (only `@utils.escalate` to a human and `@utils.transition`). So a pure no-agent server-side cutoff is out.

- **(2b) Counter INSIDE the agent — this works, and it's FREE.** Agent Script's deterministic phase (`if`/`set`, evaluated by the runtime, not the LLM) plus the FREE `@utils.setVariables` and `@utils.transition` utilities (production-gotchas: "FREE | Framework state management") let you build a real, runtime-enforced hard stop with **zero per-turn Flex cost**:
  1. A mutable counter: `repeatCount: mutable number = 0` (+ optional `lastRequest: mutable string`).
  2. A FREE `track_repeat: @utils.setVariables` action in each conversational subagent's **reasoning** `actions:` block (utilities go in reasoning actions, NOT the subagent-level action-definitions block — that one requires `target:` and will fail to compile). System instruction: each turn, if the message is the SAME already-answered request → set `repeatCount` one higher and do NOT re-run a business action; if NEW → reset to 0 and update `lastRequest`.
  3. A **deterministic gate at the TOP of every conversational subagent's** `instructions: ->` (the post-action loop re-resolves the *current* subagent each turn, so the gate must live in each one, not only the router):
     ```agentscript
     instructions: ->
         if @variables.repeatCount >= 3:
             | The same request kept repeating, so I'll close our chat here. Start a new chat anytime.
             transition to @subagent.conversation_closed
         | ...normal instructions...
     ```
  4. An **inert terminal subagent** `conversation_closed` (mirror `off_topic`: reasoning with one closing line, **no `actions:` block**). Since there's no native endChat, this IS the "end": the agent goes inert, runs no actions (zero credit burn), and the session closes on the inactivity timeout. Optionally `@utils.escalate` instead if you want a human handoff rather than a silent close.

  Proven live on `Kwitko_Concierge_Web` v126: identical message ×N → turn 1 answers (1 action), turn 2 acknowledges (no action), turn 3 → transitions to `conversation_closed` and stays inert. The counter is LLM-incremented (via the FREE setVariables) but the *cutoff* is runtime-deterministic once it hits the threshold; Layer 1 remains the behavioral backstop. A custom/owned channel can additionally do a true server-side cap by persisting each inbound message to a triggerable object yourself.

**Layer 3 — edge controls.** ⚠️ For native MIAW the chat UI runs in a **Salesforce-hosted iframe** and the conversation goes to a **Salesforce-hosted SCRT endpoint**, so the parent page can't read keystrokes inside the iframe and you can't WAF Salesforce's domain — per-message client throttling is **limited** on MIAW. What DOES work on MIAW: **CAPTCHA / bot-check before the chat opens** (gates session creation), the **session inactivity timeout**, pre-chat friction, and **monitoring + Digital Wallet alerts**. Full per-message client-side rate-limiting/cooldown is only available on a **custom/owned chat front-end** (your own UI calling the SCRT API), where you control the send path. Salesforce will not cool down the user for you.

**Checklist additions:**
- [ ] Is the always-on loop/abuse guard in the agent's top-level instructions (no action re-run on repeats → acknowledge → escalate/end)?
- [ ] Is the repeat-guard implemented as INSTRUCTION (free), not a per-turn guard ACTION (billable Apex/Flow)?
- [ ] Is the Layer-2 deterministic counter built: `repeatCount` var + FREE `track_repeat: @utils.setVariables` (in reasoning actions) + `if @variables.repeatCount >= 3: transition to @subagent.conversation_closed` at the TOP of EVERY conversational subagent + an inert `conversation_closed` terminal subagent (no actions)?
- [ ] Are `@utils.setVariables`/`@utils.transition` confirmed FREE, and is the counter LLM-incremented (not a billable per-turn Apex action)?
- [ ] Is there an edge rate-limit / CAPTCHA so floods never reach the channel?
- [ ] Confirmed: no native cooldown / no native endChat utility — the exit + the inert terminal "end" are built, not assumed.
